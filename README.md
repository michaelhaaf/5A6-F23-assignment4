# 5A6-F23-assignment4

Includes starter code for each of the labs in Assignment 4. Your respositories should look something like this when you get started -- when you are finished, you should have 3 open pull requests for each codelab.

You may use the same pull request template I have in the .github/ folder.

**NOTE:** I have four example pull requests -- you only need to do three of them yourself (Accessibility, Datastore, and only ONE of the coroutine/kotlin-bootcamps)

**NOTE:** The example accessibility codelab I have here is the longer one (Accessibility in Jetpack Compose). If you choose the shorter one (Starting Android Accessibility) your pull request/starter code will look different than mine (and that's fine). See [assignment 4 clarification about Accessibility codelab](http://localhost:4321/5A6-F23/assignments/assignment-4/#user-content-fn-2) if you don't know what this note is talking about.
